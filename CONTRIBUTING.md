# What you can do

If you...

## ...know how to code

You can:

- Write code. Add features, fix bugs, improve user experience.
  - Please do adhere to nice quality standards, although don't worry
    about fitting in. We are welcoming!
- Write documentation/guides
- Contribute to the website (repo: <https://github.com/Mrmayman/Mrmayman.github.io>)
- Work on CI/build system/tests

## ...are good at art/design

You can:

- Suggest UI improvements, polish, better design
- Make mockups or better UI designs

## ...otherwise

- Find and report issues, give feedback
- Fix typos/grammar mistakes (English isn't my first language)
- Most importantly, share this launcher with your friends!

# Before you submit a PR

- Check if the feature works on your machine
- Clean stuff up, try to follow the codebase guidelines
- Help us along the way, give a good description of what you did

# Notes on AI-Generated code

AI-assisted contributions can be messy, inconsistent, or just wrong.
Please avoid submitting large, unreviewed dumps of machine-generated code.

Please consider that there's an (overworked) human
on the other end sifting through it.

That said, **AI tools are allowed** as long as the output is reviewed and understood.
Treat them as helpers, not replacements for thought or design.

> Thereâ€™s nothing worse than writing for the sake of writing,
> with nothing behind it. It's almost intellectually dishonest in a way.
